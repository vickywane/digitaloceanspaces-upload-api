# Digitalocean Golang file uploads API


### Introduction

The ability of a user to upload their personal files when using an application is often considered a needed feature. However, when using a GraphQL API, this feature could become a challenge to implement, especially with GraphQL’s single source of truth design in your client application.

As you follow through the steps in this article, you would learn about the [Spaces](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/spaces/), and [Managed Databases](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/managed-databases/) services from [Digitalocean](https://www.digitalocean.com) and how you can programmatically upload files to a created bucket from a Golang Application using an S3-compatible [AWS-GO](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/api/) SDK.

By the end of this tutorial, you would have built a GraphQL API using Golang that has the ability to receive a media file from a [multipart HTTP request](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/describing-request-body/multipart-requests/) and upload the file to a bucket within [Digitalocean Spaces](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/spaces/) as shown in the high level diagram below: 

![High level diagram of GraphQL upload API](https://i.imgur.com/v3rbTaO.png)

## Prerequisites

To get the best out of this article, you would need the following;

-  Basic knowledge of [Golang](https://golang.org/). If you are new to Golang, the [How To Write Your First Program In Go](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-write-your-first-program-in-go) article practically explains the Golang Programming Language and the [How To Code in Go](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorial_series/how-to-code-in-go) series contains articles explaining how to configure a [MacOS](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-go-and-set-up-a-local-programming-environment-on-macos), [Linux](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-go-and-set-up-a-local-programming-environment-on-ubuntu-18-04), and [Windows](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-go-and-set-up-a-local-programming-environment-on-windows-10) computer for building Golang applications.

-   An understanding of [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/). Although the GraphQL terminologies used in this article are explained, the [Introduction To GraphQL](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/conceptual_articles/an-introduction-to-graphql) article gives a deeper introduction into what GraphQL APIs are all about.

-   A [Digitalocean account](https://www.digitalocean.com/), as the [Spaces](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/spaces/) and [App Platform](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/app-platform/) products from Digitalocean are used within this article.

-  [Git](https://git-scm.com/) installed and configured on your local machine.

## Terminologies

Below are some frequent terminologies used when working GraphQL. Understanding what these terminologies mean would be quite helpful as they often used when working within this tutorial;

- Resolver: As the name implies, a resolver is a function that resolves or returns a value for a GraphQL field. This value could be an object or a scalar type such as a string, number, or even a boolean. In this article, we would use a resolver to mutate data within the GraphQL API.

- Query:  A query is an operation in GraphQL to fetch data, similar to the `GET` HTTP verb in a REST API.

- Mutation: A mutation is an operation used to insert or mutate existing data in a GraphQL application, similar to the `POST`, `PATCH`, `PUT` HTTP verbs in a REST API. 

## Step 1 — Bootstrapping a Golang GraphQL API

In this article, you would use the [Gqlgen](https://github.com/99designs/gqlgen) library to bootstrap the GraphQL API. Gqlgen is a Go library for building GraphQL APIs. A Schema first approach and Code generation are two important features that Gqlgen provides that would be beneficial while building this API.

Using the Schema First Approach feature, you get to define the data model for the API using the GraphQL [Schema Definition Language](http://graphql.org/learn/schema/) (SDL), then you generate the boilerplate code for the API from the defined schema using the code generation feature. 

Execute the command below from your terminal in your project directory to create a `go.mod` file that manages the modules within the API project;

```command 
 go mod init
```

Next, install the Gqlgen library into your project;

```command
 go get github.com/99designs/gqlgen
```

Then using the installed Gqlgen library, generate the boilerplate files needed for a GraphQL API;

```command
 gqlgen init 
```

Running the `gqlgen` command above would generate a `server.go` file for running the GraphQL server and a `graph` directory containing a `schema.graphqls` file that would contain the Schema Definitions for the GraphQL API.


### Defining Application GraphQL Schema

By default, the `gqlgen init` command previously executed would generate the schema for a TODO application within the `schema.graphqls` file. While this is a valid schema, the application intended for this tutorial is not a TODO application. Hence, you would need to change the boilerplate schema.

To create a suitable schema for the API we are building, open the `schema.graphqls` file in your preferred code editor and replace the boilerplate schema with the schema in the code snippet below;


```graphql
[label schema.graphls]

scalar Upload

type User {
  id: ID!
  fullName: String!
  email: String!
  img_uri: String!
}

type Query {
  user: User!
}

input NewUser {
  fullName: String!
  email: String!
  img_uri: String
  password : String!
}

input ProfileImage {
  userId: String
  file: Upload
}

type Mutation {
  createUser(input: NewUser!): User!
  uploadProfileImage(input: ProfileImage!): Boolean!
}
```


The code block above contains a schema with three types; the Upload and User types which are known as Object types in the GraphQL [Schema Definition Language](http://graphql.org/learn/schema/).

<$>[note]
**Note:** The Upload scalar type is automatically defined by Gqlgen and it contains the properties of a file. To use it, you only need to declare it at the top of the schema file, as it was done in the code block above.
<$>

The schema in the code block above also contains a Mutation type containing the `CreateUser` and `uploadProfileImage` fields and the `user` field returning a single user type as the `Query`. 

At this point, you have defined the structure of the data model for the application through the `schema.graphq1s` file, the next step is to generate the query and mutation resolvers functions for the schema above using Gqlgen's code generation feature.


## Step 2 — Generating Application Resolvers

The Gqlgen package being used is based on a schema-first approach. A time-saving feature of Gqlgen is its ability to generate your application’s resolvers based on your defined schema in the `schema.graphqls` file. With this feature, you do not need to manually write the resolver boilerplate code, all you need to do is to focus on the actual implementation of the defined resolvers.

To utilize the code generation feature, execute the command below from a terminal in the project directory to generate the GraphQL API model files and resolvers;

```command
 gqlgen generate 
```

After executing the gqlgen command above, you would observe that some new files have been generated and your project now has the folder structure shown below;

![Generated Folder Structure](https://i.imgur.com/APlA6d7.png)

Among the files shown in the image above, of interest is the `schema.resolvers.go` file. As shown in the code block below, it contains an implementation of the Mutation and Query types previously defined in the `schema.graphqls` file. 

```go

package graph

import (
	"context"
	"fmt"

	"github.com/vickywane/graphql-api/graph/generated"
	"github.com/vickywane/graphql-api/graph/model"
)

func (r *mutationResolver) CreateUser(ctx context.Context, input model.NewUser) (*model.User, error) {
	panic(fmt.Errorf("not implemented"))
}

func (r *mutationResolver) UploadProfileImage(ctx context.Context, input model.ProfileImage) (bool, error) {
	panic(fmt.Errorf("not implemented"))
}

func (r *queryResolver) Users(ctx context.Context) ([]*model.User, error) {
	panic(fmt.Errorf("not implemented"))
}

func (r *Resolver) Mutation() generated.MutationResolver { return &mutationResolver{r} }

func (r *Resolver) Query() generated.QueryResolver { return &queryResolver{r} }

type mutationResolver struct{ *Resolver }
type queryResolver struct{ *Resolver }

```

As defined in the `schema.graphqls` file, two mutations, and one query resolver function were generated by Gqlgen's code generator. These resolvers would serve the following purposes;

* CreateUser - This would mutation resolver would be used to insert a new user record into the connected Postgres database.

* UploadProfileImage - This mutation resolver would be used to upload a media file received from a [multipart HTTP request](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/describing-request-body/multipart-requests/) and upload the file to a bucket within [Digitalocean Spaces](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/spaces/). After the file upload, an update would be made to insert the URL of the uploaded file into the `img_uri` field of the previously created user.

*  Users - This query resolver would query the database for all existing users and return them as the query result.

Going through the functions generated from the Mutation and Query types, you would observe that they cause a [panic](https://golang.org/src/runtime/panic.go) with a "**not implemented**" error when executed. This indicates that they are still auto-generated boilerplate code. Later in this tutorial, we would come back to the `schema.resolver.go` file to implement these generated functions.

## Step 3 — Provisioning and Using a Managed Database Instance on DigitalOcean

Although the application would not store images directly in a database, it still needs a database to insert each user‘s record. The stored record would then contain links to the uploaded files.

A user’s record would consist of a **Fullname**, **email**, **dateCreated,** and an **img_uri** field of String data type. The **img_uri** field would contain the URL pointing to an image file uploaded by a user through this GraphQL API and stored within a bucket on Digitalocean spaces.

Using your Digitalocean dashboard, navigate to the Databases section of the console to create a new database cluster. By default, [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) would be the selected database to be provisioned within this cluster. Leave all other settings at their default values and proceed to create this cluster using the button at the bottom.

![Digitalocean database cluster](https://i.imgur.com/3mlpWBj.png)

After the cluster has been created, the connection details of the cluster would be displayed. You can also find the cluster credentials by clicking the **Actions** dropdown then selecting the **Connection details** option.

![Digitalocean database cluster credentials](https://i.imgur.com/9U2k8I1.png)

From the right gray box in the image above, you would notice the connection credentials of the created demo cluster. 

Create a `.env` file within the root directory of the GraphQL-API project to securely store the cluster credentials as environment variables in the following format;

<$>[note]
**Note:** Make sure to replace the placeholder values in the `.env` file with the corresponding values from the digitalocean database credentials.
<$>

```bash
[label .env]

 DB_PASSWORD=<^><PASSWORD><^>
 DB_PORT=<^><PORT><^>
 DB_NAME=<^><DATABASE><^>
 DB_ADDR=<^><HOST><^>
 DB_USER=<^><USERNAME><^>
```

With the connection details securely stored in the .env file above, the next step would be to connect to the database cluster through our backend application.

To connect to the newly created database within the cluster, you need a database driver. Execute the command below to install [go-pg](https://github.com/go-pg/pg), a golang library for translating ORM queries into SQL Queries before executing them against a Postgres database.

Create a `db.go` file within the `graph` package directory. You would gradually put together the code within the file to establish a connection with the Postgres database created in the [Managed Databases](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/managed-databases/) cluster.

First, add the content of the code block below into the `db.go` file to create a user table in the Postgres database immediately after a connection to the database has been established.

```go
[label server.go]
package db

import (
	"fmt"
	"github.com/go-pg/pg/v9"
	"github.com/go-pg/pg/v9/orm"
	"github.com/vickywane/api/graph/model"
	"os"
)

func createSchema(db *pg.DB) error {
	for _, models := range []interface{}{(*model.User)(nil), (*model.User)(nil)}{
		if err := db.CreateTable(models, &orm.CreateTableOptions{
			IfNotExists: true
		}); err != nil {
			panic(err)
		}
	}

	return nil
}
```

Using the `IfNotExists` option passed to the `CreateTable` method from [go-pg](https://github.com/go-pg/pg), the `createSchema` function in the code block above only inserts a new table into the database if the table does not exist. You can understand this process as a simplified form of seeding a newly created database, rather than creating the Tables manually through a command-line client or GUI, the `createSchema` function takes care of the table creation.

Next, add the content of the code block below into the `db.go` file to establish a connection to the Postgres database and execute the `createSchema` function above when a connection has been established successfully.

```go
[label server.go]

func Connect() *pg.DB {
	DB_PASSWORD := os.Getenv("DB_PASSWORD")
	DB_PORT := os.Getenv("DB_PORT")
	DB_NAME := os.Getenv("DB_NAME")
	DB_ADDR := os.Getenv("DB_ADDR")
	DB_USER := os.Getenv("DB_USER")

	connStr := fmt.Sprintf(
		"postgresql://%v:%v@%v:%v/%v?sslmode=require",
		DB_USER, DB_PASSWORD, DB_ADDR, DB_PORT, DB_NAME )

	opt, err := pg.ParseURL(connStr); if err != nil {
  	  panic(err)
      }

	db := pg.Connect(opt)

	if schemaErr := createSchema(db); schemaErr != nil {
		panic(schemaErr)
	}

	if _, DBStatus := db.Exec("SELECT 1"); DBStatus != nil {
		panic("PostgreSQL is down")
	}

	return db
}
```

The exported `Connect` function in the code block above when executed establishes a connection to a Postgres database using [go-pg](https://github.com/go-pg/pg) and returns the connection instance. This done through the following operations explained below;

* First, the database credentials you stored in the root `.env` file are retrieved, then, a variable is created to store a string formatted with the retrieved credentials. This variable would be used as a connection URI when connecting with the database.

* Next, the created connection string is parsed to know if the formatted credentials are valid. If valid, the connection string is passed into the `connect` method as an argument to establish a connection. 

To use the exported `Connect` function, you need to add it to the `server.go` file to execute the `Connect` function when the application is started and the instance would also be available in the `Resolver` struct.

Open the `server.go` file in your preferred code editor and add the lines highlighted below into the `server.go` file to utilize the previously created `db` package immediately after the application is started.


```go
[label db/db.go]
 package main

import (
  "log"
  "net/http"
  "os"

  "github.com/vickywane/api/graph/db"
  "github.com/99designs/gqlgen/graphql/handler"
  "github.com/99designs/gqlgen/graphql/playground"
  "github.com/vickywane/api/graph"
  "github.com/vickywane/api/graph/generated"
)

const defaultPort = "8080"

func main() {
  port := os.Getenv("PORT")
  if port == "" {
     port = defaultPort
  }

  Database := db.Connect()
  srv := handler.NewDefaultServer(
    generated.NewExecutableSchema(generated.Config{
       Resolvers: &graph.Resolver{
    		DB: Database,
 	 }
    }))

  http.Handle("/", playground.Handler("GraphQL playground", "/query"))
  http.Handle("/query", srv)

  log.Printf("connect to http://localhost:%s/ for GraphQL playground", port)
  log.Fatal(http.ListenAndServe(":"+port, nil))
}
```


Within the code snippet above, you expressed the Connect function from the DB package in the `Database` variable then you passed in the connected database client into the graph resolver.

Lastly, you need to specify the data type of the DB field you added in the Resolver struct above.

To achieve this, open the `resolver.go` file and modify the Resolver struct to have a DB field with a `go-pg` pointer as its type as shown below;


``` go
[label resolver.go]
package resolvers

import (
	"fmt"
	"github.com/go-pg/pg/v9"
	"sync"

	"github.com/vickywane/event-server/graph/model"
)

type Resolver struct {
	DB *pg.DB
}
```


Now a database connection would be established each time the entry `server.go` file is run and the `go-pg` package can be used as an ORM to perform operations on the database from the resolver functions.


## Step 4 — Implementing Generated Resolvers

#### Mutation Resolvers

Going through the `schema.graphqls` file, there are only two mutation resolvers generated. One with the purpose of handling the user's creation, while the other handles the profile image uploads.

Modify the `CreateUser` mutation with the code snippet below to insert a new row containing the user details input into the database


```go
[label schema.resolver.go]
package graph

import (
  "context"
  "fmt"
  "time"

  "github.com/satori/go.uuid"
  "github.com/vickywane/api/graph/generated"
  "github.com/vickywane/api/graph/model"
)

func (r *mutationResolver) CreateUser(ctx context.Context, input model.NewUser) (*model.User, error) {
  user := model.User{
     ID:          fmt.Sprintf("%v", uuid.NewV4()),
     FullName:    input.FullName,
     Password:    input.Password,
     Email:       input.Email,
     ImgURI:      "https://bit.ly/3mCSn2i",
     DateCreated: time.Now().Format("01-02-2006"),
  }

  if err := r.DB.Insert(&user); err != nil {
     return nil, fmt.Errorf("error inserting user: %v", err)
  }

  return &user, nil
}
```


Going through the `CreateUser` mutation in the code snippet above, you would observe two things about the user rows inserted;

*   Each row inserted is given a unique UUID formatted as a string.
*   The `ImgURI` field in each row has a placeholder image URL as the default value. This would be updated when a user uploads a new image. 

To test the resolver above from your browser, navigate to `http://localhost:8080` to access the GraphQL playground built-in to your GraphQL API. Paste the GraphQL Mutation in the code block below into the playground editor to insert a new user record.

```graphql
[label graphql]

mutation createUser {
  createUser(
    input: {
      email: "johndoe@gmail.com"
      fullName: "John Doe"
      password: "password"
    }
  ) {
    id
  }
}
```

![A create user mutation on the GraphQL Playround](https://i.imgur.com/57Q16Ir.png)

Going through the image above, you executed the `CreateUser` mutation to create a test user with the name of **John Doe**, and you returned the `id` of the newly inserted user record as the result of the mutation. 

At this point, you have the second `UploadProfileImage` mutation resolver function left to implement, but before you implement this function, you need to implement the query resolver first. This is because each upload is linked to a specific user, hence the need to retrieve the ID of a specific user before uploading an image.

#### Query Resolver

As defined in the `schema.graphqls` file, one query resolver was generated for the purpose of retrieving all created users.

Modify the generated `Users` query resolver with the code block below to query the Postgres database for all user rows. 


```go
[label schema.graphqls]
package graph

import (
  "context"
  "fmt"
  "time"

  "github.com/satori/go.uuid"
  "github.com/vickywane/api/graph/generated"
  "github.com/vickywane/api/graph/model"
)

func (r *queryResolver) Users(ctx context.Context) ([]*model.User, error) {
  var users []*model.User

  r.DB.Model(&users).Select()

  return users, nil  
}
```

Within the `Users` resolver function above, fetching all records within the user table is made possible by using go-pg’s `select` method on the `User` model without passing `WHERE` or `LIMIT` clause into the query.

To test this query resolver from your browser, navigate to `http://localhost:8080` to access the GraphQL playground. Paste the GraphQL Query below into the playground editor to fetch all created user records.

```graphql
[label graphql]

query fetchUsers {
  users {
      fulName
      id
      img_uri
  }
}
```

![Query result GraphQL playground](https://i.imgur.com/RWh2Cmv.png)

Going through the right side of the image above, you would notice that a `users` object having an array value was returned. For now, only the previously created user was returned in the `users` array because that it is the only record in the table. More users would be returned in the `users` array if you execute the previous Mutation with new user values. You would also observe that the `img_uri` field in the first object has the hardcoded fallback image URL.

At this point, you have now implemented both the `CreateUser` mutation and the `User` query. Everything is in place for you to implement receiving images from the second `UploadProfileImage` resolver and uploading the received image to a bucket with Digitalocean Spaces through the use of an S3 compatible [AWS-GO](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/api/) SDK.

## Step 5 — Uploading Images To Digitalocean Spaces

[Spaces](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/spaces/) is a simple, and scalable cloud-based object storage service from Digitalocean. You would use the powerful API within the second `UploadProfileImage` mutation to upload images.

To begin, navigate to the Spaces section of your DigitalOcean console where you would create a new bucket for storing the uploaded files from your backend application.

Click the **Create New Space** button, leaving other settings at their default values, and specify a unique name for the new space as shown below before creating your new space;

![Digitalocean spaces](https://i.imgur.com/Aifnmzf.png)

After a new Space has been created, navigate to the settings tab and copy the space’s endpoint into the GraphQL project environment variables.


```bash
[label .env]
SPACE_ENDPOINT=<^><BUCKET_ENDPOINT><^>
```


Next, using [this guide](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/spaces/how-to/manage-access/#acwithin the Digitalocean Spaces documentation that explains the process of creating secret and access keys, create a secret and access key for the API access-keys) within the Digitalocean Spaces documentation that explains the process of creating secret and access keys, create a secret and access key for the backend application. After creating them, copy the values and store them in your backend application’s `.env` file in the format below;


```bash
[label .env]
ACCESS_KEY=<^><SPACE_ACCESS_KEY><^>
SECRET_KEY=<^><SPACE_SECRET_KEY><^>
```

One way to programmatically perform operations on your bucket within [Spaces](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/spaces/) is through the use of compatible AWS SDKs. The Digitalocean Spaces [documentation](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/spaces/) provides a list of operations you can perform on the Spaces API using an AWS SDK.

Using the next few code snippets, you would gradually put together the upload logic in the `UploadProfileImage` mutation resolver.

First, add the code highlighted in the preceding code block into the `schema.resolvers/go` file to create a configure and create a session from Spaces to the local `aws-sdk-go` SDK using the `access_key` and `secret_key` credentials you stored in the `.env` file.

```go
[label schema.resolvers.go]
package graph

import (
   "bytes"
   "context"
   "fmt"
   "os"

   "github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go/aws"
   "github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go/aws/credentials"
   "github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go/aws/session"
   "github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go/service/s3"
   "io"

   "github.com/vickywane/api/graph/generated"
   "github.com/vickywane/api/graph/model"
)

func (r *mutationResolver) UploadProfileImage(ctx context.Context, input model.ProfileImage) (bool, error) {
<^><^>
<^>  SpaceName := os.Getenv("DO_SPACE_NAME")<^>
<^>	SpaceRegion := os.Getenv("DO_SPACE_REGION")<^>
<^>	key := os.Getenv("ACCESS_KEY")<^>
<^>	secret := os.Getenv("ACCESS_SECRET")<^>
<^><^>
<^>	s3Config := &aws.Config{<^>
<^>		Credentials: credentials.NewStaticCredentials(key, secret, ""),<^>
<^>		Endpoint:    aws.String(fmt.Sprintf("https://%v.digitaloceanspaces.com", SpaceRegion)),<^>
<^>		Region:      aws.String(SpaceRegion),<^>
<^>	}<^>
<^><^>
<^>	newSession := session.New(s3Config)<^>
<^>	s3Client := s3.New(newSession)<^>
<^><^>
 
	return true, nil
}
```

With the SDK configured above, the next line of action is to upload the file sent in the [multipart HTTP request](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/describing-request-body/multipart-requests/).

A way to handle files sent is to read the content from the [multipart request](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/describing-request-body/multipart-requests/), temporarily save the content to a new file in memory, then upload the temporary file using the `aws-SDK-go` library, then delete it after an upload. 

To achieve this, add the content of the highlighted Go code below to the existing code within the `UploadProfileImage` mutation resolver in the `schema.resolvers.go`.

```go
[label schema.resolvers.go]

package graph

import (
   "bytes"
   "context"
   "fmt"
   "os"

   "github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go/aws"
   "github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go/aws/credentials"
   "github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go/aws/session"
   "github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go/service/s3"
   "io"

   "github.com/vickywane/api/graph/generated"
   "github.com/vickywane/api/graph/model"
)

func (r *mutationResolver) UploadProfileImage(ctx context.Context, input model.ProfileImage) (bool, error) {
 <^><^>
<^>  userFileName := fmt.Sprintf("%v-img.png", input.UserID)<^>
<^>  stream, readErr := ioutil.ReadAll(input.File.File)<^>
<^>	if readErr != nil {<^>
<^>		fmt.Printf("error from file %v", readErr)<^>
<^>	}<^>
<^><^>
<^>	fileErr := ioutil.WriteFile(userFileName, stream, 0644)<^>
<^>		fmt.Printf("file err %v", fileErr)<^>
<^>	}<^>
<^><^>
<^>	file, openErr := os.Open(userFileName)<^>
<^>	if openErr != nil {<^>
<^>		fmt.Printf("Error opening file: %v", openErr)<^>
<^>	}<^>
<^><^>
<^>	defer file.Close()<^>
<^><^>
<^>	buffer := make([]byte, input.File.Size)<^>
<^><^>
<^>	fileBytes := bytes.NewReader(buffer)<^>
<^><^>
<^>	object := s3.PutObjectInput{<^>
<^>		Bucket: aws.String(SpaceName),<^>
<^>		Key:    aws.String(fmt.Sprintf("%v-%v", *input.UserID, input.File.Filename)),<^>
<^>		Body:   fileBytes,<^>
<^>		ACL:    aws.String("public-read"),<^>
<^>	}<^>
<^><^>
<^>	if _, uploadErr := s3Client.PutObject(&object); uploadErr != nil {<^>
<^>		return false, fmt.Errorf("error uploading file: %v", uploadErr)<^>
<^>	}<^>
<^><^>
<^>	_ = os.Remove(userFileName)<^>

 
	return true, nil
}
```

Using the [ReadAll](https://golang.org/pkg/io/#ReadAll) method from the [io](https://golang.org/pkg/io/) package in the code block above, you read the content of the file added to the multipart request sent to the GraphQL API, then a temporary file was created to dump this content into.

Next, using the [PutObjectInput](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/api/service/s3/#PutObjectInput) struct we created the structure of the file to be uploaded by specifying the `Bucket`, `Key`, `ACL` and `Body` field to be content of the temporarily stored file.

**Note:** The [Access Control List](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/acl-overview.html) (ACL) field in the `PutObjectInput` struct has a `public-read` value to make all uploaded files available for viewing over the internet.
<$>

After creating the `PutObjectInput` struct, the `PutObject` method is used to make a `PUT` operation, sending the de-ferenced values of the `PutObjectInput` struct to the bucket. If there is an error, a false boolean value and an error message are returned, ending the execution of the resolver function and the mutation in general.     

To test the upload implementation in the mutation resolver, execute the command below to make an HTTP request to the GraphQL API using cURL, adding an image into the request form body.

``` command
curl localhost:8080/query  -F operations='{ "query": "mutation uploadProfileImage($image: Upload! $userId : String!) { uploadProfileImage(input: { file: $image  userId : $userId}) }", "variables": { "image": null, "userId" : "121212" } }' -F map='{ "0": ["variables.image"] }'  -F 0=@sample.jpeg
```

After the command above has been executed to upload a file, the following stringified data would be printed out in the terminal as the request's response, indicating that the file upload was successful.


```
[secondary_label Output]
{"data": { "uploadProfileImage": true }}
```

Going through your created bucket within the Spaces section of the Digitalocean console, you would find the image recently uploaded from your terminal.

At this point, file uploads within the application are working, however, the files are not getting linked back to the user who performed the upload. The requirement of each file upload performed through this API is to have the file uploaded into a storage bucket and then linked back to a user by updating the `img_uri` field of the user. 

Add the content of the code block below into the `resolvers.go` file in the graph directory. It contains two helper functions, one to retrieve a user from the database by a specified field, and the other function to update the record of a user.

```go
[label resolvers.go]

func (r *mutationResolver) GetUserByField(field, value string) (*model.User, error) {
	user := model.User{}

	err := r.DB.Model(&user).Where(fmt.Sprintf("%v = ?", field), value).First()

	return &user, err
}


func (r *mutationResolver) UpdateUser(user *model.User) (*model.User, error) {
	_, err := r.DB.Model(user).Where("id = ?", user.ID).Update()
	return user, err
}

```

The first `GetUserByField` function above accepts a `field` and `value` argument, both being of a string type. Using go-pg's ORM, it executes a query on the database, fetching data from the user table with a `WHERE` clause.

The second `UpdateUser` function in the code block uses go-pg to execute an `UPDATE` statement to update a record in the user table. Using the where method attached, a `WHERE` clause with a condition is added to the `UPDATE` statement to update only the row having the same `ID` passed into the function.

Now you can make use of the two helper functions in the `UploadProfileImage` mutation. Add the content of the highlighted code block below to retrieve a specific row from the user table, and update the `img_uri` field in the user's record after the file has been uploaded.

```go
[label schema.resolvers.go]

package graph

import (
   "bytes"
   "context"
   "fmt"
   "os"

   "github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go/aws"
   "github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go/aws/credentials"
   "github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go/aws/session"
   "github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go/service/s3"
   "io"

   "github.com/vickywane/api/graph/generated"
   "github.com/vickywane/api/graph/model"
)

func (r *mutationResolver) UploadProfileImage(ctx context.Context, input model.ProfileImage) (bool, error) {
 <^><^>
<^>  user, userErr := r.GetUserByField("ID", *input.UserID)<^>
<^><^>
<^>	if userErr != nil {<^>
<^>		return false, fmt.Errorf("error getting user: %v", userErr)<^>
<^>	}<^>
<^><^>
<^> fileUrl := fmt.Sprintf("https://%v.%v.digitaloceanspaces.com/%v-%v", SpaceName, SpaceRegion, *input.UserID, input.File.Filename)<^>
<^><^>
<^>	user.ImgURI = fileUrl<^>
<^><^>
<^> 	if _, err := r.UpdateUser(user); err != nil {<^>
<^>		return false, fmt.Errorf("err updating user: %v", err)<^>
<^>	}<^>
 

	return true, nil
}
```

From the new code added to the `schema.resolvers.go` file, an `ID` string and the user's ID are passed to the `GetUserByField` helper function to retrieve the record of the user executing the mutation. 

A new variable is then created and given the value of a string formatted to have the link of the recently uploaded file in the format of `https://<BUCKET_NAME>.<SPACE_REGION>.digitaloceanspaces.com/<USER_ID>-<FILE_NAME>`. The `ImgURI` field in the retrieved user model was reassigned the value of the formatted string as a link to the uploaded file. 

Execute the command below to test the user record update within the `UploadProfileImage` mutation by making a POST request having an image in the form body to the GraphQL API endpoint. 

``` command
curl localhost:8080/query  -F operations='{ "query": "mutation uploadProfileImage($image: Upload! $userId : String!) { uploadProfileImage(input: { file: $image  userId : $userId}) }", "variables": { "image": null, "userId" : "121212" } }' -F map='{ "0": ["variables.image"] }'  -F 0=@sample.jpeg
```

After the request has been made, you would get a response similar to the first one as an output.

```
[secondary_label Output]
{"data": { "uploadProfileImage": true }}
```

To further confirm that the user's `ImgUrl` was updated, you can use the `getUser` query from the GraphQL playground in the browser to retrieve the user's detail. If the update in the previous mutation was successful, you would observe that the default placeholder URL of `https://bit.ly/3mCSn2i` has been updated to point to an actual image uploaded by the user.

![A query mutation to retrieve an updated user record using the GraphQL Playground](https://i.imgur.com/WPLxxm7.png)

From the image above, you would notice `img_uri` in the first user object returned from the query has a value that corresponds to a file upload to a bucket within Digitalocean Spaces. The link in the `img_uri`  field is made up of the bucket endpoint, the user's ID, and lastly the filename.  

To test the permission of the uploaded file set through the ACL option, you can open the `img_uri` link in your browser. You should be able to view the exact image uploaded when you made the POST request using cURL from your terminal.

![Browser view of the uploaded file](https://i.imgur.com/hMTexa1.png)

The image above shows exactly the same image that was uploaded from the command line, indicating that the helper functions were executed correctly and the entire file upload logic in the `UploadProfileImage` mutation works as expected.

### Deploying The GraphQL API to App Platform

<$>[info]
**Info:**  [App platform](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/app-platform/) is a Digitalocean service product that makes it much easier to build, deploy, and even auto-scale your applications. [App platform](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/app-platform/) supports a variety of languages and within this article, you would utilize the support for applications written in Go and stored within [GitHub](https://github.com).
<$>

To begin deploying your backend application, create a local git repository by executing the command below from a terminal;

```command
 git init
```

Add your latest changes from all files into the local repository by running the command below from your terminal

```command 
 git add .
```

Then using the command below, commit the recent file changes made within the repository.

```command
git commit -m "feat: implemented upload functionality"
```

Next, create a public repository on GitHub using the [Github getting started guide](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/create-a-repo) that explains the process of creating a repository and pushing local changes into the new repository.

From your Digitalocean dashboard, navigate to the Apps section and select GitHub as the source to connect your Digitalocean account to GitHub. After the integration, select the newly created repository above from the Repository dropdown.

![Digitalocean App platform source deployment](https://i.imgur.com/YeALP5g.png)

In the next configuration page, define the environment variables for the application as defined in your local `.env` file as shown below;


![Environment variables for deploying a Golang Application to Digitalocean App Platform](https://i.imgur.com/tiEl0wx.png)


Leaving other settings at their defaults, click the **Next** button to move to the next page where you would give this deployment a unique name, then navigate to the remaining pages to finalize the deployment and build the app.


### Step 6 — Testing The Deployed GraphQL Endpoint

At this point, the application has been fully deployed to the [App Platform](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/app-platform/), with a healthy running status similar to the one shown in the image below;

![Health status of a Golang application deployed to Digitalocean App Platform](https://i.imgur.com/Nbjeph7.png)


Take note of the endpoint URL of your deployed application placed below the application name. you would use this endpoint to test the upload feature implemented in the deployed GraphQL API with [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) as an API testing tool.


<$>[info]
**Note:** If you do not have the Postman Desktop App installed on your local machine, you can make use of the Postman Web Client within your browser.
<$>

From your Postman collection, create a new POST request with a form-data body having the following keys;

<$>[info]
**Note**: You should replace the USER_ID placeholder with the ID of a user you created using the `CreateUser` mutation. You would also need to change the file field below to a file type before you can select a file on your machine.
<$>


*   operations: [{"key":"operations","value":"{\"query\": \"mutation uploadImage($userID: String! $image: Upload!) {\\n uploadProfileImage(input: { userId: $userID file: $image }
*   map: {"file": ["variables.image"], "userId": ["variables.userID"]}
*   userId: &lt;USER_ID>
*   file: &lt;LOCAL_FILE>

![Using Postman Form-Body to add images to a POST request using a GraphQL API](https://i.imgur.com/fOj229w.png)


Hit the Send button to send the POST request, then reload your Digitalocean Space bucket to see your newly uploaded file.
